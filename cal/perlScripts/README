How to run different CALIFA geometry versions:


1- Select the geometry version from the existing models.
   There are three geometry versions available:
	- CALIFA 5.0, including BARREL and ENDCAP.
	- CALIFA 7.05, only BARREL
	- CALIFA 7.07, only BARREL

   or alternatively create your own script for a user-defined geometry (quite complex, see below).



2- For each geometry, the procedure is different:

   CALIFA 5.0: the code is included in R3BCalo.cxx. So, simply select the geometry in the simulation/analysis macro:
	  R3BDetector* calo = new R3BCalo("Califa", kTRUE);
          //Selecting the geometry
          // 0 CALIFA V5 (old), 1 CALIFA V7.05, 2 USER DEFINED
          ((R3BCalo *)calo)->SelectGeometryVersion(0);

	(see, for instance macros/r3b/califa/r3ball.C)


   CALIFA 7.05: it is also included as an option in R3BCalo.cxx, but the code is generated externally by the
	perl script cal/perlScripts/createGeometryCLF705.pl. The output of the macro (CLF705_Geometry.geo) is
	included in the R3BCalo.cxx code, but if the user modifies anything (like wrapping thicknes, …), the 
	code in the directory cal should be recompiled. In the simulation/analysis macro, you should select:
	  R3BDetector* calo = new R3BCalo("Califa", kTRUE);
          //Selecting the geometry
          // 0 CALIFA V5 (old), 1 CALIFA V7.05, 2 USER DEFINED
          ((R3BCalo *)calo)->SelectGeometryVersion(1);


   CALIFA 7.07: it is NOT included as a separate option in R3BCalo.cxx, but has to be included as an user-defined
	version. The code is generated externally by the perl script cal/perlScripts/createGeometryCLF707.pl. 
	The output of the macro (CLF707_Geometry.geo) must be renamed to UserDefinedGeometry.geo, which is
	included in the R3BCalo.cxx code. If the user modifies anything (like wrapping thicknes, …), the 
	code in the directory cal should be recompiled.
	  R3BDetector* calo = new R3BCalo("Califa", kTRUE);
          //Selecting the geometry
          // 0 CALIFA V5 (old), 1 CALIFA V7.05, 2 USER DEFINED
          ((R3BCalo *)calo)->SelectGeometryVersion(2);


3- Remember to compile the code after any geometrical modification!
